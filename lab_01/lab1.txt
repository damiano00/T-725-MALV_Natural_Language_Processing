The history of NLP generally starts in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods. 
In 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence.

The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. 
The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem. 
However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. 
Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.

Up to the 1980s, most NLP systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. 
Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in NLP with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. 
This was due both to the steady increase in computational power resulting from Moore's Law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing.
