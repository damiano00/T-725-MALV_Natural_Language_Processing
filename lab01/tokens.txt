the
history
of
nlp
generally
starts
in
the
1950s
although
work
can
be
found
from
earlier
periods
in
1950
alan
turing
published
an
article
titled
computing
machinery
and
intelligence
which
proposed
what
is
now
called
the
turing
test
as
a
criterion
of
intelligence
the
georgetown
experiment
in
1954
involved
fully
automatic
translation
of
more
than
sixty
russian
sentences
into
english
the
authors
claimed
that
within
three
or
five
years
machine
translation
would
be
a
solved
problem
however
real
progress
was
much
slower
and
after
the
alpac
report
in
1966
which
found
that
ten
years
long
research
had
failed
to
fulfill
the
expectations
funding
for
machine
translation
was
dramatically
reduced
little
further
research
in
machine
translation
was
conducted
until
the
late
1980s
when
the
first
statistical
machine
translation
systems
were
developed
up
to
the
1980s
most
nlp
systems
were
based
on
complex
sets
of
hand
written
rules
starting
in
the
late
1980s
however
there
was
a
revolution
in
nlp
with
the
introduction
of
machine
learning
algorithms
for
language
processing
this
was
due
both
to
the
steady
increase
in
computational
power
resulting
from
moore
s
law
and
the
gradual
lessening
of
the
dominance
of
chomskyan
theories
of
linguistics
e
g
transformational
grammar
whose
theoretical
underpinnings
discouraged
the
sort
of
corpus
linguistics
that
underlies
the
machine
learning
approach
to
language
processing
