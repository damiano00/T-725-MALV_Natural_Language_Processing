        "  * Adds the user's current input to the `Conversation` by calling `add_user_input` on the `convo` object, passing the `input`.\n",
        "  * Passes the `convo` object to the `bot` to make the model generate a response.\n",
        "  * The `bot` object outputs the whole conversation by default, so we call `generated_responses` to get a simple list of the generated responses so far, and get the last item in the list (i.e., the most recent response).\n",
        "  * Then we update the `history`, which is a list of tuples: (user-input, bot-response)\n",

        "  * Creates widgets from a predefined Gradio layout for a 'chatbot'\n",
